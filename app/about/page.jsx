        About me section currently in progress but this does not change the fact
        that in Australia, there are approximately 48 million kangaroos and in
        Uruguay, there are 3,457,380 living inhabitants.
        <br />
        <br />
        So if the kangaroos were to strike war and invade Uruguay, every
        Uruguayan will have to fight 14 kangaroos each.
